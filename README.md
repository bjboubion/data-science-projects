### Biography: 
Hi there, I'm Bryan.
My goal is to enter the ever evolving field of data science, where the technology is ever changing. After my first experience of data science via structural biology, I have made it a mission of mine to truly and thoroughly learn the ins and outs of this thriving field, and to also bring these skills back to the realm of scientific research. Using my scientific expertise, I feel well equipped for this endeavor and I look forward to showing the world what I can do.

Currently, there I have 3 projects:

1. Webscraping Apartments.com in search of data from 3 different counties: LA County, Orange County, and San Diego County. The goal of this project is twofold: Firstly, to learn and enhance my webscraping abilities (using the BeautifulSoup4 library) and to use this data to generate a simple predictive model in my own apartment hunt.

2. Data exploration and analysis of Kobe Bryant's shot making capabilities. The data is from a previous Kaggle competition and documents over 30,000 shots kobe has taken throughout his 20 year career. This was a great dataset to clean and transform in order to gain even more clarify and respect for Kobe's career. 

3. Another data exploration project, this time using FIFA datasets, ranging from individual players, to individual matches, to World Cups as a whole.

I started these projects with limited knowledge of Python and it's corresponding libraries, and so I have learned some fantastic technologies, including:

- [Python Programming Language](https://www.python.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib PyPlot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

I am also competent in web development technologies, including but not limited to:
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- React.js
- Node.js
- ASP.NET and C# programming language
- Familiarity with Flask
